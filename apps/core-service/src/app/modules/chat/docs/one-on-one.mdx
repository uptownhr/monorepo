One on One Conversations
========================

# Sendbird implementation

Sendbird does not have "one on one messages", but all messaging is done through channels.

**R1 (this may change as we increment)**
To support this, we will use simple a `channel_url` constructed from the userIDs of the participants:
```ts
const channel_url = [userId1, userId2].sort().join('-');
```


# ACLs
One on one chat is currently allowed between:
- A manager and their direct report
- And owner/admin and anybody at the company.
