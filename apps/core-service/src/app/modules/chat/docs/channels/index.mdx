Group Channel
=============

A **Group Channel** is a channel maintained by Bambee's Groups.  Group membership is the primary access control to allow a
user to entry a group channel and send messages.

## Initial Implementation
The initial implementation will be with "On demand association".  A user will be added to a channel on request via the API, and not automatically.

## M2
We plan on having automatic group management in core-service using SNS/SQS.  Doing so weill enable us to automatically add/remove users from groups in our DB, and also groups in sendbird.
